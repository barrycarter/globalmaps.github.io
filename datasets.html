	<h1>Available Data Sets</h1>
	<div class="box1">
		<p>Global Map data mainly have two categories, which are:</p>
		<p><a href="#national">National/Regional version</a>：　Global Map data sets of consistent specifications developed by and with the responsibilities of NGIAs of respective countries and regions for their individual coverage.</p>
		<p><a href="#global">Global version</a>：　Global Map data sets developed by the secretariat of the ISCGM in cooperation with NGIAs of respective countries/regions, and/or other organizations for the entire land of the globe as a whole.</p>

		<h2 id="national">National/Regional version</h2>
		<p><a href="national.html">Global Map data of National/Regional version</a> had been developed and provided by NGIAs of respective countries and regions. The data are derived from their geospatial information and are in consistent specifications for fundamental geospatial information of their respective coverage. As the data sets had been prepared in unified specifications, the data of different countries and regions can be handled at once with the same manner. The data had been developed by NGIAs of respective countries and regions, and thus, their contents are authorized.</p>
		<p>Data of National/Regional version are in digital format at a scale of 1:1 million. There are four sets of vector data and four sets of raster data and in total eight layers have been developed.</p>

		<p>Global Map of Global version for various geospatial information of the whole land of the globe developed mainly by the secretariat of the ISCGM in cooperation with NGIAs and/or related organizations. As the whole land of the globe has been developed as one data set, the data can be used for analyses of large areas.</p>
		<p>The following three categories of data sets had been developed and are provided as a Global version:</p>
		<ul> 
			<li><a href="el.html">Elevation</a>
			<li><a href="glcnmo.html">Land Cover (Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations :GLCNMO)</a>
			<li><a href="ptc.html">Vegetation (Percent Tree Cover :PTC)</a>
		</ul>
		<p>The data had been developed in line with Global Map Specifications. Depending on the period of the data development, there are two versions, namely, version 1 and version 2.</p>
